# Contributing to emitron

👋 Welcome! Thanks for expressing an interest in contributing to the raywenderlich.com app.

## Testing

Once you have the project open in Xcode, select the `Emitron` scheme and use `CMD+U` to run the tests.

Don't forget to add tests for any new features you add or contribute to.

If you are fixing a single GitHub issue in particular, please add a test named `testGH<issue number>` to ensure that your fix is working. This will also help prevent regression.

## User Account

In order to use __emitron__, you must currently be a video subscriber to raywenderlich.com. If you are keen to contribute to the project, but are unable to use features of the app due to a lack of a raywenderlich.com subscription, please contact emitron@razeware.com noting which feature or area of the app you are interested in contributing to, and we should be able to set you up with appropriate access.

## Access Tokens

As mentioned in the readme, __emitron__ requires two secret tokens. This repo contains a sample API token, that will allow you to interact with the API, allowing you to develop the app.

However, it does not contain the token that will allow access to downloads. If you wish to work on the video downloads feature, please contact emitron@razeware.com with the link to the development proposal in GitHub, and you will be provided with an appropriate token.

## API Documentation

__emitron__ interfaces with the raywenderlich.com API to retrieve data. You can find API documentation here:

https://raywenderlich.docs.apiary.io

## New Features

If you would like to suggest new features, please open an issue for discussion, and include a development proposal. Although the app is open source, Razeware reserves the right to direct new feature development, and to modify, request changes to, or reject feature proposals as it sees fit.

Thanks! Your work on this app will help support our worldwide community of mobile developers as they strive to improve their skills in the industry.
