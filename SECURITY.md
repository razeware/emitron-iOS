# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you come across a security vulnerability in __emitron__, or any of the raywenderlich.com infrastructure that it connects to, please do not file an
issue on GitHub.

Instead, please document your issue as fully as you can, and email your issue report directly to emitron@razeware.com.

We take security very seriously, and will assess any reports first before we embark upon getting them fixed as soon as possible.

Thanks!
